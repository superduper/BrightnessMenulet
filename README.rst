Brightness Menulet
==================

**This software contains a feature that might harm your external Monitor, use it on your own without any warranty from my side.**


Allows you to control monitor brigthness via menu in status bar and automatically based on the ambient light sensor in your mac (if supported) .

Download app build: `BrightnessMenulet.app`_.

Change list (done by me `mhewedy`):
............

- Add support for ambient light sensor, so the Menulet now set brightness automatically based on the built-in light sensor.
- Add support for icon in case of Dark Menu.

Original Change list:
............

- Fixed brightness control ( at least it works for my Dell monitor )
- Removed brightness value polling (too slow)


Roadmap:
........

- Add keyboard bindings
- Add contrast control
