Brightness Menulet
==================

**This tool is not stable and almost not maintained. Use at your own risk. Try to look at forks, there's a chance your LCD model might be supported**

Allows you to control monitor brigthness via menu in status bar.

This tool works on OSX 10.8+. If you have tested your monitor(s) with this tool, please
let me know wether it worked or not so I can add monitor models here. Preference's Debug button logs to the
console VCP codes and their values on the selected monitor.
